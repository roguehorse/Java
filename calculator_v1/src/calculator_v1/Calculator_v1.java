/*
 * ****Retail Calculator****
 * A retailer would like a calculator to indicate sale prices when he marks
 * items down at various percentages.
 * 
 * **Design, implement, test, and debug a GUI application that allows the
 * retailer to enter the item’s name, the item’s original price, and the 
 * percentage discounted.
 * 
 * **The application should include a Calculate button that,when pressed,
 * computes and displays the sale price in a label or text field.
 * 
 * *The program should allow the retailer to enter any number of items in this 
 * manner.
 * *Include an Exit button to end the execution of the application.
 * *The program should allow the user to select a department from a menu.
 * You may create the menu as a true menu, a JComboBox, or radio buttons.
 * *Create your own list to populate the menu: men’s clothing, women’s clothing,
 * house wares, and so forth.
 * *Include at least five departments.
 * *Create a JTextArea or a JTable to display each of the following for each 
 * item entered.
 * 
 * *Item name 
 * *Department
 * *Original price
 * *Sale price
